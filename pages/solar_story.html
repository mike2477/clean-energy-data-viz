            The United States has undergone a massive shift in its power generation over the last 20 years. 
            The share of coal has fallen from 52% to 30%, while natural gas has risen from 13% to 32%. 
            Renewables have also risen from 2% to 10%, 
            while nuclear has remained relatively stable at 20%.

                    <p>Coal emissions began declining in America for two main reasons: </p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>The fracking boom in America that led to a fall in natural gas prices; </li>
                        <li> The dramatic fall in the price of renewable energy.</li>

                    <p> Let's look at how those two changes affected coal emissions.</p>
